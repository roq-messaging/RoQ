                <h3>Welcome to RoQ</h3>
                <p class="lead">RoQ (pronounce /rɒkˈjuː/, as in "Rock You") is the first implementation of <abbr title="Elastic Queue Service">EQS</abbr>, a new architecture designed for efficient messaging in the cloud.</p>
                <h4>A new way to transmit messages in the cloud</h4>
                <h5>Elastic scalability</h5>
                  <p>
                    Traditionally, <abbr title="Message Oriented Middleware">MOM</abbr>s are not designed to support elastic scaling. This means that in a cloud context, they may very quickly become a bottleneck in terms of performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    RoQ has been designed from day 1 to answer this problem. Its architecture is <em>elastically scalable</em>. This includes three properties:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>When required, the capacity of the system will be increased automatically</li>
                      <li>This capacity increase has no impact on the global performance</li>
                      <li>When the load decreases, the system will scale down to avoid using unnecessary ressources</li>
                  </ul>
                <h5>Open Source</h5>
                  <p>
                  RoQ started as a research project within EURA NOVA (<a href="http://euranova.eu" title="EURA NOVA">http://euranova.eu</a>) and has since then evolved into an open-source project. This means that anyone can download the code, see how it works, contribute or even fork the code to build upon RoQ.
                  </p>
                <h5>Cloud Ready</h5>
                  <p>
                    As already explained, RoQ, with its distributed architecture and its ability to be quickly deployed on a cloud, is designed to ease the usage of <abbr title="Message Oriented Middleware">MOM</abbr> in a cloud context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, the major competitor of RoQ is Amazon SQS. However, a benchmarking article by the Cloud Computing Center (see <a href="http://db.tt/5Xbm7Gtg">the complete article</a> to learn more) points out the inability for SQS to scale properly. RoQ is there to solve this problem!

                <h3>Introducing RoQ</h3>
                <p class="lead">RoQ is a message oriented middleware (<abbr title="Message Oriented Middleware">MOM</abbr>), built from the start with elastic scalability in mind.</p>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                In the current Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) landscape, most of the popular products allow setups distributed on a cluster of machines. However global performance in these clustered MOMs is a tradeoff on the amount of node in the cluster, the amount of connected clients and the dynamic nature of the connections. Indeed, all the nodes in these messaging clusters share the state of the messaging service. As the size of the cluster grows, the overhead in managing the shared state depends on the amount of clients connected (states to maintain) and the dynamic nature of the connections (states update rate) and thus limits the message processing ability of the cluster.
                </p>
                <img src="images/tradeoff.png" alt="Traditional Architecture Trade Off" />
                <p>On the other side, the elastic scalability is the ability to scale by starting up new instances in the service. Cloud computing platforms enable applications to make use of elastic scalability: instances are started in an on-demand scheme when more perfomance is needed, and are shut down when the load comes back to normal. This kind of applications requires stateless and distributed elements in the architecture.
                </p>
                <p>RoQ is the implementation of a MOM suitable for deployment on the cloud which enables elastic scaling. It is suited for environments where a big amount of clients and messages need to transit on the MOM.
                </p>
                <h4>Architecture</h4>
                <p>At a 10,000 feet of altitude, the architecture of RoQ comprises the following distributed elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exchanges</strong>: these are the components which transmit messages from producers to listeners. They can perform message filtering based on a routing key. Exchanges are stateless and are the elements which are elastically scalable</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: this is the component which monitors the health of the exchanges</li>
                    <li><strong>Queue Management</strong>: this component stores the meta data related to the queues</li>
                    <li><strong>Rules and Scaling Management</strong>: this is where the information on the automatic scaling of the exchanges is stored. Based on information delivered by the Monitoring, this component is able to trigger scale out (start instances) or scale in (stop instances) actions with regards to the user KPIs.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="images/RoQArch.png" alt="RoQ Architecture" />
                <p>The Monitoring, Queue Management and Rules and Scaling Management can be architecturally positioned on the Cloud Infrastructure Management. However given the current segmentation in the API of the Cloud management tools, we also deliver these components in stand-alone packages.</p>
